## Overview
* Raw scripts/Pipeline for analysis performed in manuscript *Machine learning approach informs biology of cancer drug response*.
* Analysis can be replicated by script provided in folders named after each drug
* Scripts used to perform confirmatory analysis can be found in confirm folder

## Drug analysis
1. First download array expression data from GDSC. There's no live link to the file I used, so I uploaded it to dropbox. Place this file in the common_files folder
*  https://www.dropbox.com/s/63d664sknfh8iv3/sanger1018_brainarray_ensemblgene_rma.txt?dl=0
2. Run findFeatures.R to perform the analysis
* This script is broken down into sections 

## Additional analysis
1. Run analysis.R in confirm folder
* This script will perform the exploratory and confirmatory analysis. Script is broken down into sections corresponding to figures 4-6.
